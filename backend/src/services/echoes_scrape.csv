Gaudí's works reflect an individualized and distinctive style. Most are located in Barcelona, including his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família. Gaudí's work was influenced by his passions in life: architecture, nature, and religion. Gaudí considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry. He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as trencadís which used waste ceramic pieces. Under the influence of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques, Gaudí became part of the Modernista movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work transcended mainstream Modernisme, culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms. Gaudí rarely drew detailed plans of his works, instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and molding the details as he conceived them. Gaudí's work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by architects.",Age: Dec. at 73 (1852-1926),"Place of Birth: Tarragona, Reus, Spain","Structures: Sagrada Família, Church of Colònia Güell, Episcopal Palace, Astorga, Palau Güell"

His furniture designs were considered Scandinavian Modern. What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a Gesamtkunstwerk, a total work of art; whereby he – together with his first wife Aino Aalto – would design not just the building, but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture, lamps, and furnishings and glassware.

He created an influential twentieth-century architectural style, stated with extreme clarity and simplicity. His mature buildings made use of modern materials such as industrial steel and plate glass to define interior spaces. He strove toward an architecture with a minimal framework of structural order balanced against the implied freedom of free-flowing open space. He called his buildings ""skin and bones"" architecture.

Smirke designed public buildings in the classical style, including the main block and facade of the British Museum, the east wing of Somerset House and the adjacent King's (formerly Smirke) Building of King's College London, and the Royal College of Physicians building in Trafalgar Square (now known as Canada House). His domestic buildings were often in the Gothic style. Lowther Castle in Cumbria was his first job, in 1806, when he was just 25. Eastnor Castle was designed by him in the early 19th century. His buildings outside London included the Shire Halls of Gloucester, Shrewsbury and Hereford, plus alterations to Luton Hoo house. He also designed the second incarnation of the Covent Garden Theatre, now the Royal Opera House (destroyed by fire in 1857), and the General Post Office building in St Martins-le-Grand in the City of London (built between 1825 and 1829 (demolished c. 1910). Together with John Nash and Sir John Soane, he became official architect to the Office of Works in 1813. He advised the Parliamentary Commissioners on the building of new Churches from 1818 onwards, contributing four himself, including St George, Brandon Hill in Bristol. He was knighted in 1832, and received the RIBA Royal Gold Medal for Architecture in 1853. His brother Sydney Smirke was also an architect, best known for the circular reading room at the British Museum.

His skill in manipulating marble ensured that he would be considered a worthy successor of Michelangelo, far outshining other sculptors of his generation, including his rival, Alessandro Algardi. His talent extended beyond the confines of sculpture to a consideration of the setting in which it would be situated; his ability to synthesize sculpture, painting and architecture into a coherent conceptual and visual whole has been termed by the art historian Irving Levin the ""unity of the visual arts"".",Age: Dec. at 81 (1598-1680),"Place of Birth: Naples, Italy","Structures: Trevi Fountain, Palazzo Montecitorio, St. Peter's Basilica, Palazzo Barberini, Sant'Andrea al Quirinale"

Steiner gained initial recognition at the end of the nineteenth century as a literary critic and published philosophical works including The Philosophy of Freedom. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he founded an esoteric spiritual movement, anthroposophy, with roots in German idealist philosophy and theosophy; other influences include Goethean science and Rosicrucianism. In the first, more philosophically oriented phase of this movement, Steiner attempted to find a synthesis between science and spirituality; his philosophical work of these years, which he termed spiritual science, sought to apply the clarity of thinking characteristic of Western philosophy to spiritual questions, differentiating this approach from what he considered to be vaguer approaches to mysticism. In a second phase, beginning around 1907, he began working collaboratively in a variety of artistic media, including drama, the movement arts and architecture, culminating in the building of the Goetheanum, a cultural centre to house all the arts.",Age: Dec. at 64 (1861-1925),"Place of Birth: Donji Kraljevec, Croatia","Structures: Second Goetheanum, Goetheanum"

The son of a bricklayer, he rose to the top of his profession, becoming professor of architecture at the Royal Academy and an official architect to the Office of Works. He received a knighthood in 1831. His architectural works are distinguished by their clean lines, massing of simple form, decisive detailing, careful proportions and skilful use of light sources. The influence of his work, coming at the end of the Georgian era, was swamped by the revival styles of the 19th century. It was not until the late 19th century that the influence of Sir John's architecture was widely felt. His best-known work was the Bank of England, a building which had a widespread effect on commercial architecture. He also designed Dulwich Picture Gallery, which, with its top-lit galleries, was a major influence on the planning of subsequent art galleries and museums. His main legacy is an eponymous museum in Lincoln's Inn Fields, which comprises his former home and office, designed to display the art works and architectural artifacts that he collected during his lifetime.",Age: Dec. at 83 (1753-1837),"Place of Birth: Reading, United Kingdom","Structures: Wotton House, Chillington Hall, Wimpole Hall, Stock Office, Bank of England"

His designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering. Though Brunel's projects were not always successful, they often contained innovative solutions to long-standing engineering problems. During his short career, Brunel achieved many engineering ""firsts"", including assisting in the building of the first tunnel under a navigable river and development of SS Great Britain, the first propeller-driven ocean-going iron ship, which was at the time also the largest ship ever built. Brunel set the standard for a well-built railway, using careful surveys to minimise grades and curves. This necessitated expensive construction techniques and new bridges and viaducts, and the two-mile-long Box Tunnel. One controversial feature was the wide gauge, a ""broad gauge"" of 7 ft ¹⁄₄ in, instead of what was later to be known as 'standard gauge' of 4 ft 8 ¹⁄₂ in.",Age: Dec. at 53 (1806-1859),"Place of Birth: Portsmouth, United Kingdom","Structures: Hungerford Bridge and Golden Jubilee Bridges, Box Tunnel, Moulsford Railway Bridge, Clifton Suspension Bridge, Wharncliffe Viaduct"
